 * This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into 
 * application.css, which will include all the files listed 
 * below.
 *
 * Any CSS (and SCSS, if configured) file within this directory, 
 * lib/assets/stylesheets, or any plugin's 
 * vendor/assets/stylesheets directory can be referenced here 
 * using a relative path.
 *
 * You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and 
 * they'll appear at the bottom of the compiled file so the 
 * styles you add here take precedence over styles defined in 
 * any other CSS files in this directory. Styles in this file 
 * should be added after the last require_* statement.
 * It is generally better to create a new file per style scope.
